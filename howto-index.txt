GIT Howto Index
===============

Here is a collection of mailing list postings made by various
people describing how they use git in their workflow.

* link:howto/isolate-bugs-with-bisect.txt[isolate-bugs-with-bisect] by Linus Torvalds <torvalds () osdl ! org>

Short-n-sweet, Linus tells us how to leverage `git-bisect` to perform
bug isolation on a repository where "good" and "bad" revisions are known
in order to identify a suspect commit.


* link:howto/make-dist.txt[make-dist] by Linus Torvalds <torvalds@osdl.org>

In this article, Linus talks about building a tarball,
incremental patch, and ChangeLog, given a base release and two
rc releases, following the convention of giving the patch from
the base release and the latest rc, with ChangeLog between the
last rc and the latest rc.


* link:howto/rebase-and-edit.txt[rebase-and-edit] by Linus Torvalds <torvalds@osdl.org>

In this article, Linus demonstrates how a broken commit
in a sequence of commits can be removed by rewinding the head and
reapplying selected changes.


* link:howto/rebase-from-internal-branch.txt[rebase-from-internal-branch] by Junio C Hamano <junkio@cox.net>

In this article, JC talks about how he rebases the
public "pu" branch using the core GIT tools when he updates
the "master" branch, and how "rebase" works.  Also discussed
is how this applies to individual developers who sends patches
upstream.


* link:howto/rebuild-from-update-hook.txt[rebuild-from-update-hook] by Junio C Hamano <junkio@cox.net>

In this how-to article, JC talks about how he
uses the post-update hook to automate git documentation page
shown at http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/.


* link:howto/revert-branch-rebase.html[revert-branch-rebase] by Junio C Hamano <junkio@cox.net>

In this article, JC gives a small real-life example of using
'git revert' command, and using a temporary branch and tag for safety
and easier sanity checking.


* link:howto/update-hook-example.txt[update-hook-example] by Junio C Hamano <junkio@cox.net> and Carl Baldwin <cnb@fc.hp.com>

An example hooks/update script is presented to
implement repository maintenance policies, such as who can push
into which branch and who can make a tag.


* link:howto/using-topic-branches.txt[using-topic-branches] by tony.luck@intel.com

In this article, Tony Luck discusses how he uses GIT
as a Linux subsystem maintainer.

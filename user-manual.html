read this manual.</p><p>The best way to get one is by using the <a href="git-clone.html" target="_top">git-clone(1)</a> command
to download a copy of an existing repository for a project that you
are interested in.  If you don't already have a project in mind, here
are some interesting examples:</p><div class="literallayout"><p>        # git itself (approx. 10MB download):<br>
$ git clone git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git<br>
        # the linux kernel (approx. 150MB download):<br>
$ git clone git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git</p></div><p>The initial clone may be time-consuming for a large project, but you
will only need to clone once.</p><p>The clone command creates a new directory named after the project
("git" or "linux-2.6" in the examples above).  After you cd into this
directory, you will see that it contains a copy of the project files,
together with a special top-level directory named ".git", which
contains all the information about the history of the project.</p><p>In most of the following, examples will be taken from one of the two
repositories above.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="id232603"></a>How to check out a different version of a project</h2></div></div></div><p>Git is best thought of as a tool for storing the history of a
collection of files.  It stores the history as a compressed
collection of interrelated snapshots (versions) of the project's
contents.</p><p>A single git repository may contain multiple branches.  Each branch
is a bookmark referencing a particular point in the project history.
The <a href="git-branch.html" target="_top">git-branch(1)</a> command shows you the list of branches:</p><div class="literallayout"><p>$ git branch<br>
* master</p></div><p>A freshly cloned repository contains a single branch, named "master",
and the working directory contains the version of the project
referred to by the master branch.</p><p>Most projects also use tags.  Tags, like branches, are references
into the project's history, and can be listed using the
<a href="git-tag.html" target="_top">git-tag(1)</a> command:</p><div class="literallayout"><p>$ git tag -l<br>
v2.6.11<br>
v2.6.11-tree<br>
v2.6.12<br>
v2.6.12-rc2<br>
v2.6.12-rc3<br>
v2.6.12-rc4<br>
v2.6.12-rc5<br>
v2.6.12-rc6<br>
v2.6.13<br>
...</p></div><p>Tags are expected to always point at the same version of a project,
while branches are expected to advance as development progresses.</p><p>Create a new branch pointing to one of these versions and check it
out using <a href="git-checkout.html" target="_top">git-checkout(1)</a>:</p><div class="literallayout"><p>$ git checkout -b new v2.6.13</p></div><p>The working directory then reflects the contents that the project had
when it was tagged v2.6.13, and <a href="git-branch.html" target="_top">git-branch(1)</a> shows two
branches, with an asterisk marking the currently checked-out branch:</p><div class="literallayout"><p>$ git branch<br>
  master<br>
* new</p></div><p>If you decide that you'd rather see version 2.6.17, you can modify
the current branch to point at v2.6.17 instead, with</p><div class="literallayout"><p>$ git reset --hard v2.6.17</p></div><p>Note that if the current branch was your only reference to a
particular point in history, then resetting that branch may leave you
with no way to find the history it used to point to; so use this
command carefully.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="id273448"></a>Understanding History: Commits</h2></div></div></div><p>Every change in the history of a project is represented by a commit.
The <a href="git-show.html" target="_top">git-show(1)</a> command shows the most recent commit on the

    [XFRM]: Fix aevent structuring to be more complete.<br>
<br>
    aevents can not uniquely identify an SA. We break the ABI with this<br>
    patch, but consensus is that since it is not yet utilized by any<br>
    (known) application then it is fine (better do it now than later).<br>

did, and why.</p><p>Every commit has a 40-hexdigit id, sometimes called the "object name"
or the "SHA1 id", shown on the first line of the "git show" output.
You can usually refer to a commit by a shorter name, such as a tag or a
branch name, but this longer name can also be useful.  Most
importantly, it is a globally unique name for this commit: so if you
tell somebody else the object name (for example in email), then you are
guaranteed that name will refer to the same commit in their repository
that it does in yours (assuming their repository has that commit at
all).</p><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id273497"></a>Understanding history: commits, parents, and reachability</h3></div></div></div><p>Every commit (except the very first commit in a project) also has a
parent commit which shows what happened before this commit.
Following the chain of parents will eventually take you back to the
beginning of the project.</p><p>However, the commits do not form a simple list; git allows lines of
development to diverge and then reconverge, and the point where two
lines of development reconverge is called a "merge".  The commit
representing a merge can therefore have more than one parent, with
each parent representing the most recent commit on one of the lines
of development leading to that point.</p><p>The best way to see how this works is using the <a href="gitk.html" target="_top">gitk(1)</a>
command; running gitk now on a git repository and looking for merge
commits will help understand how the git organizes history.</p><p>In the following, we say that commit X is "reachable" from commit Y
if commit X is an ancestor of commit Y.  Equivalently, you could say
that Y is a descendent of X, or that there is a chain of parents
leading from commit Y to commit X.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id273537"></a>Understanding history: History diagrams</h3></div></div></div><p>We will sometimes represent git history using diagrams like the one

be replaced with another letter or number.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id273565"></a>Understanding history: What is a branch?</h3></div></div></div><p>Though we've been using the word "branch" to mean a kind of reference
to a particular commit, the word branch is also commonly used to
refer to the line of commits leading up to that point.  In the
example above, git may think of the branch named "A" as just a
pointer to one particular commit, but we may refer informally to the
line of three commits leading up to that point as all being part of
"branch A".</p><p>If we need to make it clear that we're just talking about the most
recent commit on the branch, we may refer to that commit as the
"head" of the branch.</p></div></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="id232302"></a>Manipulating branches</h2></div></div></div><p>Creating, deleting, and modifying branches is quick and easy; here's
a summary of the commands:</p><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term">

</dd><dt><span class="term">
git branch &lt;branch&gt; &lt;start-point&gt;
</span></dt><dd>
        create a new branch named &lt;branch&gt;, referencing
        &lt;start-point&gt;, which may be specified any way you like,
        including using a branch name or a tag name
</dd><dt><span class="term">
git branch -d &lt;branch&gt;
</span></dt><dd>
        delete the branch &lt;branch&gt;; if the branch you are deleting
        points to a commit which is not reachable from this branch,
        this command will fail with a warning.
</dd><dt><span class="term">
git branch -D &lt;branch&gt;
</span></dt><dd>
        even if the branch points to a commit not reachable
        from the current branch, you may know that that commit
        is still reachable from some other branch or tag.  In that
        case it is safe to use this command to force git to delete
        the branch.
</dd><dt><span class="term">
git checkout &lt;branch&gt;

        make the current branch &lt;branch&gt;, updating the working

be used to refer to the current branch.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="id273789"></a>Examining branches from a remote repository</h2></div></div></div><p>The "master" branch that was created at the time you cloned is a copy
of the HEAD in the repository that you cloned from.  That repository
may also have had other branches, though, and your local repository
keeps branches which track each of those remote branches, which you
can view using the "-r" option to <a href="git-branch.html" target="_top">git-branch(1)</a>:</p><div class="literallayout"><p>$ git branch -r<br>

examine them on a branch of your own, just as you would a tag:</p><div class="literallayout"><p>$ git checkout -b my-todo-copy origin/todo</p></div><p>Note that the name "origin" is just the name that git uses by default

commits.  All references are named with a slash-separated path name
starting with "refs"; the names we've been using so far are actually
shorthand:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li>
The branch "test" is short for "refs/heads/test".
</li><li>
The tag "v2.6.18" is short for "refs/tags/v2.6.18".
</li><li>
"origin/master" is short for "refs/remotes/origin/master".
</li></ul></div><p>The full name is occasionally useful if, for example, there ever
exists a tag and a branch with the same name.</p><p>As another useful shortcut, if the repository "origin" posesses only
a single branch, you can refer to that branch as just "origin".</p><p>More generally, if you have defined a remote repository named
"example", you can refer to the branch in that repository as
"example".  And for a repository with multiple branches, this will
refer to the branch designated as the "HEAD" branch.</p><p>For the complete list of paths which git checks for references, and
the order it uses to decide which to choose when there are multiple
references with the same shorthand name, see the "SPECIFYING
REVISIONS" section of <a href="git-rev-parse.html" target="_top">git-rev-parse(1)</a>.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="Updating-a-repository-with-git-fetch"></a>Updating a repository with git fetch</h2></div></div></div><p>Eventually the developer cloned from will do additional work in her

repository.  It will not touch any of your own branches&#8212;not even the
"master" branch that was created for you on clone.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="id274034"></a>Fetching branches from other repositories</h2></div></div></div><p>You can also track branches from repositories other than the one you

that you gave "git remote add", in this case linux-nfs:</p><div class="literallayout"><p>$ git branch -r<br>
linux-nfs/master<br>
origin/master</p></div><p>If you run "git fetch &lt;remote&gt;" later, the tracking branches for the

a new stanza:</p><div class="literallayout"><p>$ cat .git/config<br>

collection of files.  It does this by storing compressed snapshots of
the contents of a file heirarchy, together with "commits" which show
the relationships between these snapshots.</p><p>Git provides extremely flexible and fast tools for exploring the
history of a project.</p><p>We start with one specialized tool that is useful for finding the
commit that introduced a bug into a project.</p><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="id274131"></a>How to use bisect to find a regression</h2></div></div></div><p>Suppose version 2.6.18 of your project worked, but the version at
"master" crashes.  Sometimes the best way to find the cause of such a
regression is to perform a brute-force search through the project's
history to find the particular commit that caused the problem.  The
<a href="git-bisect.html" target="_top">git-bisect(1)</a> command can help you do this:</p><div class="literallayout"><p>$ git bisect start<br>
$ git bisect good v2.6.18<br>
$ git bisect bad master<br>
Bisecting: 3537 revisions left to test after this<br>
[65934a9a028b88e83e2b0f8b36618fe503349f8e] BLOCK: Make USB storage depend on SCSI rather than selecting it [try #6]</p></div><p>If you run "git branch" at this point, you'll see that git has
temporarily moved you to a new branch named "bisect".  This branch
points to a commit (with commit id 65934&#8230;) that is reachable from
v2.6.19 but not from v2.6.18.  Compile and test it, and see whether
it crashes.  Assume it does crash.  Then:</p><div class="literallayout"><p>$ git bisect bad<br>
Bisecting: 1769 revisions left to test after this<br>

stage whether the version it gives you is good or bad, and notice
that the number of revisions left to test is cut approximately in
half each time.</p><p>After about 13 tests (in this case), it will output the commit id of
the guilty commit.  You can then examine the commit with
<a href="git-show.html" target="_top">git-show(1)</a>, find out who wrote it, and mail them your bug
report with the commit id.  Finally, run</p><div class="literallayout"><p>$ git bisect reset</p></div><p>to return you to the branch you were on before and delete the
temporary "bisect" branch.</p><p>Note that the version which git-bisect checks out for you at each
point is just a suggestion, and you're free to try a different
version if you think it would be a good idea.  For example,
occasionally you may land on a commit that broke something unrelated;
run</p><div class="literallayout"><p>$ git bisect-visualize</p></div><p>which will run gitk and label the commit it chose with a marker that
says "bisect".  Chose a safe-looking commit nearby, note its commit
id, and check it out with:</p><div class="literallayout"><p>$ git reset --hard fb47ddb2db...</p></div><p>then test, run "bisect good" or "bisect bad" as appropriate, and
continue.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="id274250"></a>Naming commits</h2></div></div></div><p>We have seen several ways of naming commits already:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li>
40-hexdigit object name
</li><li>
branch name: refers to the commit at the head of the given
          branch
</li><li>
tag name: refers to the commit pointed to by the given tag
          (we've seen branches and tags are special cases of
          <a href="#how-git-stores-references" title="Naming branches, tags, and other references">references</a>).
</li><li>
HEAD: refers to the head of the current branch
</li></ul></div><p>There are many more; see the "SPECIFYING REVISIONS" section of the
<a href="git-rev-parse.html" target="_top">git-rev-parse(1)</a> man page for the complete list of ways to
name revisions.  Some examples:</p><div class="literallayout"><p>$ git show fb47ddb2 # the first few characters of the object name<br>
                    # are usually enough to specify it uniquely<br>
$ git show HEAD^    # the parent of the HEAD commit<br>
$ git show HEAD^^   # the grandparent<br>
$ git show HEAD~4   # the great-great-grandparent</p></div><p>Recall that merge commits may have more than one parent; by default,
^ and ~ follow the first parent listed in the commit, but you can
also choose:</p><div class="literallayout"><p>$ git show HEAD^1   # show the first parent of HEAD<br>
$ git show HEAD^2   # show the second parent of HEAD</p></div><p>In addition to HEAD, there are several other special names for
commits:</p><p>Merges (to be discussed later), as well as operations such as
git-reset, which change the currently checked-out commit, generally
set ORIG_HEAD to the value HEAD had before the current operation.</p><p>The git-fetch operation always stores the head of the last fetched
branch in FETCH_HEAD.  For example, if you run git fetch without
specifying a local branch as the target of the operation</p><div class="literallayout"><p>$ git fetch git://example.com/proj.git theirbranch</p></div><p>the fetched commits will still be available from FETCH_HEAD.</p><p>When we discuss merges we'll also see the special name MERGE_HEAD,
which refers to the other branch that we're merging in to the current
branch.</p><p>The <a href="git-rev-parse.html" target="_top">git-rev-parse(1)</a> command is a low-level command that is
occasionally useful for translating some name for a commit to the object
name for that commit:</p><div class="literallayout"><p>$ git rev-parse origin<br>
e05db0fd4f31dde7005f075a84f96b360d05984b</p></div></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="id274501"></a>Creating tags</h2></div></div></div><p>We can also create a tag to refer to a particular commit; after
running</p><div class="literallayout"><p>$ git-tag stable-1 1b2e1d63ff</p></div><p>You can use stable-1 to refer to the commit 1b2e1d63ff.</p><p>This creates a "lightweight" tag.  If the tag is a tag you wish to
share with others, and possibly sign cryptographically, then you
should create a tag object instead; see the <a href="git-tag.html" target="_top">git-tag(1)</a> man
page for details.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="id274536"></a>Browsing revisions</h2></div></div></div><p>The <a href="git-log.html" target="_top">git-log(1)</a> command can show lists of commits.  On its
own, it shows all commits reachable from the parent commit; but you
can also make more specific requests:</p><div class="literallayout"><p>$ git log v2.5..        # commits since (not reachable from) v2.5<br>
$ git log test..master  # commits reachable from master but not test<br>
$ git log master..test  # ...reachable from test but not master<br>
$ git log master...test # ...reachable from either test or master,<br>
                        #    but not both<br>
$ git log --since="2 weeks ago" # commits from the last 2 weeks<br>
$ git log Makefile      # commits which modify Makefile<br>
$ git log fs/           # ... which modify any file under fs/<br>
$ git log -S'foo()'     # commits which add or remove any file data<br>
                        # matching the string 'foo()'</p></div><p>And of course you can combine all of these; the following finds
commits since v2.5 which touch the Makefile or any file under fs:</p><div class="literallayout"><p>$ git log v2.5.. Makefile fs/</p></div><p>You can also ask git log to show patches:</p><div class="literallayout"><p>$ git log -p</p></div><p>See the "&#8212;pretty" option in the <a href="git-log.html" target="_top">git-log(1)</a> man page for more
display options.</p><p>Note that git log starts with the most recent commit and works
backwards through the parents; however, since git history can contain
multiple independent lines of development, the particular order that
commits are listed in may be somewhat arbitrary.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="id274610"></a>Generating diffs</h2></div></div></div><p>You can generate diffs between any two versions using

contents could have been arrived at by two different historical
routes.  You could compare the object names:</p><div class="literallayout"><p>$ git rev-list origin<br>

e05db0fd tags/v1.5.0-rc1^0~23</p></div><p>The <a href="git-describe.html" target="_top">git-describe(1)</a> command does the opposite, naming the

Making some changes to the working directory using your
           favorite editor.
</li><li>
Telling git about your changes.
</li><li>
Creating the commit using the content you told git about
           in step 2.
</li></ol></div><p>In practice, you can interleave and repeat steps 1 and 2 as many
times as you want: in order to keep track of what you want committed
at step 3, git maintains a snapshot of the tree's contents in a
special staging area called "the index."</p><p>At the beginning, the content of the index will be identical to
that of the HEAD.  The command "git diff &#8212;cached", which shows
the difference between the HEAD and the index, should therefore
produce no output at that point.</p><p>Modifying the index is easy:</p><p>To update the index with the new contents of a modified file, use</p><div class="literallayout"><p>$ git add path/to/file</p></div><p>To add the contents of a new file to the index, use</p><div class="literallayout"><p>$ git add path/to/file</p></div><p>To remove a file from the index and from the working tree,</p><div class="literallayout"><p>$ git rm path/to/file</p></div><p>After each step you can verify that</p><div class="literallayout"><p>$ git diff --cached</p></div><p>always shows the difference between the HEAD and the index file&#8212;this
is what you'd commit if you created the commit now&#8212;and that</p><div class="literallayout"><p>$ git diff</p></div><p>shows the difference between the working tree and the index file.</p><p>Note that "git add" always adds just the current contents of a file
to the index; further changes to the same file will be ignored unless
you run git-add on the file again.</p><p>When you're ready, just run</p><div class="literallayout"><p>$ git commit</p></div><p>and git will prompt you for a commit message and then create the new
commit.  Check to make sure it looks like what you expected with</p><div class="literallayout"><p>$ git show</p></div><p>As a special shortcut,</p><div class="literallayout"><p>$ git commit -a</p></div><p>will update the index with any files that you've modified or removed
and create a commit, all in one step.</p><p>A number of commands are useful for keeping track of what you're
about to commit:</p><div class="literallayout"><p>$ git diff --cached # difference between HEAD and the index; what<br>
                    # would be commited if you ran "commit" now.<br>

with a single short (less than 50 character) line summarizing the
change, followed by a blank line and then a more thorough

the first line on the Subject line and the rest of the commit in the

you resolve the conflicts manually, you can update the index

creating a new file.</p><p>If you examine the resulting commit using gitk, you will see that it
has two parents, one pointing to the top of the current branch, and
one to the top of the other branch.</p><p>In more detail:</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="resolving-a-merge"></a>Resolving a merge</h2></div></div></div><p>When a merge isn't resolved automatically, git leaves the index and
the working tree in a special state that gives you all the
information you need to help resolve the merge.</p><p>Files with conflicts are marked specially in the index, so until you
resolve the problem and update the index, git commit will fail:</p><div class="literallayout"><p>$ git commit<br>
file.txt: needs merge</p></div><p>Also, git status will list those files as "unmerged".</p><p>All of the changes that git was able to merge automatically are
already added to the index file, so <a href="git-diff.html" target="_top">git-diff(1)</a> shows only
the conflicts.  Also, it uses a somewhat unusual syntax:</p><div class="literallayout"><p>$ git diff<br>

conflict will have two parents instead of the usual one: one parent
will be HEAD, the tip of the current branch; the other will be the
tip of the other branch, which is stored temporarily in MERGE_HEAD.</p><p>The diff above shows the differences between the working-tree version
of file.txt and two previous versions: one version from HEAD, and one
from MERGE_HEAD.  So instead of preceding each line by a single "+"
or "-", it now uses two columns: the first column is used for
differences between the first parent and the working directory copy,
and the second for differences between the second parent and the
working directory copy.  Thus after resolving the conflict in the
obvious way, the diff will look like:</p><div class="literallayout"><p>$ git diff<br>

++Goodbye world</p></div><p>This shows that our resolved version deleted "Hello world" from the
first parent, deleted "Goodbye" from the second parent, and added
"Goodbye world", which was previously absent from both.</p><p>The <a href="git-log.html" target="_top">git-log(1)</a> command also provides special help for merges:</p><div class="literallayout"><p>$ git log --merge</p></div><p>This will list all commits which exist only on HEAD or on MERGE_HEAD,

some information about the merge.  Normally you can just use this
default message unchanged, but you may add additional commentary of
your own if desired.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="undoing-a-merge"></a>undoing a merge</h2></div></div></div><p>If you get stuck and decide to just give up and throw the whole mess

        never do this if you have already made the history public;
        git does not normally expect the "history" of a project to
        change, and cannot correctly perform repeated merges from
        a branch that has had its history changed.

realize that the branch was the only reference you had to that point in
history.</p><p>Fortunately, git also keeps a log, called a "reflog", of all the
previous values of each branch.  So in this case you can still find the
old history using, for example,</p><div class="literallayout"><p>$ git log master@{1}</p></div><p>This lists the commits reachable from the previous version of the head.
This syntax can be used to with any git command that accepts a commit,
not just with git log.  Some other examples:</p><div class="literallayout"><p>$ git show master@{2}           # See where the branch pointed 2,<br>
$ git show master@{3}           # 3, ... changes ago.<br>
$ gitk master@{yesterday}       # See where it pointed yesterday,<br>
$ gitk master@{"1 week ago"}    # ... or last week</p></div><p>The reflogs are kept by default for 30 days, after which they may be
pruned.  See <a href="git-reflog.html" target="_top">git-reflog(1)</a> and <a href="git-gc.html" target="_top">git-gc(1)</a> to learn
how to control this pruning, and see the "SPECIFYING REVISIONS"
section of <a href="git-rev-parse.html" target="_top">git-rev-parse(1)</a> for details.</p><p>Note that the reflog history is very different from normal git history.
While normal history is shared by every repository that works on the
same project, the reflog history is not shared: it tells you only about
how the branches in your local repository have changed over time.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="id275889"></a>Examining dangling objects</h4></div></div></div><p>In some situations the reflog may not be able to save you.  For
example, suppose you delete a branch, then realize you need the history
it contained.  The reflog is also deleted; however, if you have not
yet pruned the repository, then you may still be able to find
the lost commits; run git-fsck and watch for output that mentions
"dangling commits":</p><div class="literallayout"><p>$ git fsck<br>

one of those dangling commits with, for example,</p><div class="literallayout"><p>$ gitk 7281251ddd --not --all</p></div><p>which does what it sounds like: it says that you want to see the commit
history that is described by the dangling commit(s), but not the

you get exactly the history reachable from that commit that is lost.

may wish to check the original repository for updates and merge them
into your own work.</p><p>We have already seen <a href="#Updating-a-repository-with-git-fetch" title="Updating a repository with git fetch">how to keep remote tracking branches up to date</a> with <a href="git-fetch.html" target="_top">git-fetch(1)</a>,
and how to merge two branches.  So you can merge in changes from the
original repository's master branch with:</p><div class="literallayout"><p>$ git fetch<br>
$ git merge origin/master</p></div><p>However, the <a href="git-pull.html" target="_top">git-pull(1)</a> command provides a way to do this in
one step:</p><div class="literallayout"><p>$ git pull origin master</p></div><p>In fact, "origin" is normally the default repository to pull from,
and the default branch is normally the HEAD of the remote repository,
so often you can accomplish the above with just</p><div class="literallayout"><p>$ git pull</p></div><p>See the descriptions of the branch.&lt;name&gt;.remote and
branch.&lt;name&gt;.merge options in <a href="git-config.html" target="_top">git-config(1)</a> to learn
how to control these defaults depending on the current branch.</p><p>In addition to saving you keystrokes, "git pull" also helps you by
producing a default commit message documenting the branch and
repository that you pulled from.</p><p>(But note that no such commit will be created in the case of a
<a href="#fast-forwards" title="Understanding git history: fast-forwards">fast forward</a>; instead, your branch will just be
updated to point to the latest commit from the upstream branch.)</p><p>The git-pull command can also be given "." as the "remote" repository,
in which case it just merges in a branch from the current repository; so
the commands</p><div class="literallayout"><p>$ git pull . branch<br>
$ git merge branch</p></div><p>are roughly equivalent.

just be to send them as patches in email:</p><p>First, use <a href="git-format-patch.html" target="_top">git-format-patch(1)</a>; for example:</p><div class="literallayout"><p>$ git format-patch origin</p></div><p>will produce a numbered series of files in the current directory, one
for each patch in the current branch but not in origin/HEAD.</p><p>You can then import these into your mail client and send them by
hand.  However, if you have a lot to send at once, you may prefer to
use the <a href="git-send-email.html" target="_top">git-send-email(1)</a> script to automate the process.
Consult the mailing list for your project first to determine how they
prefer such patches be handled.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="id276136"></a>Importing patches to a project</h2></div></div></div><p>Git also provides a tool called <a href="git-am.html" target="_top">git-am(1)</a> (am stands for
"apply mailbox"), for importing such an emailed series of patches.
Just save all of the patch-containing messages, in order, into a
single mailbox file, say "patches.mbox", then run</p><div class="literallayout"><p>$ git am -3 patches.mbox</p></div><p>Git will apply each patch in order; if any conflicts are found, it
will stop, and you can fix the conflicts as described in
"<a href="#resolving-a-merge" title="Resolving a merge">Resolving a merge</a>".  (The "-3" option tells
git to perform a merge; if you would prefer it just to abort and
leave your tree and index untouched, you may omit that option.)</p><p>Once the index is updated with the results of the conflict
resolution, instead of creating a new commit, just run</p><div class="literallayout"><p>$ git am --resolved</p></div><p>and git will create the commit for you and continue applying the
remaining patches from the mailbox.</p><p>The final result will be a series of commits, one for each patch in
the original mailbox, with authorship and commit log message each
taken from the message containing each patch.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="setting-up-a-public-repository"></a>Setting up a public repository</h2></div></div></div><p>Another way to submit changes to a project is to simply tell the
maintainer of that project to pull from your repository, exactly as
you did in the section "<a href="#getting-updates-with-git-pull" title="Getting updates with git pull">Getting updates with git pull</a>".</p><p>If you and maintainer both have accounts on the same machine, then
then you can just pull changes from each other's repositories
directly; note that all of the commands (<a href="git-clone.html" target="_top">git-clone(1)</a>,
git-fetch[1], git-pull[1], etc.) that accept a URL as an argument
will also accept a local file patch; so, for example, you can
use</p><div class="literallayout"><p>$ git clone /path/to/repository<br>
$ git pull /path/to/other/repository</p></div><p>If this sort of setup is inconvenient or impossible, another (more
common) option is to set up a public repository on a public server.
This also allows you to cleanly separate private work in progress
from publicly visible work.</p><p>You will continue to do your day-to-day work in your personal
repository, but periodically "push" changes from your personal
repository into your public repository, allowing other developers to
pull from that repository.  So the flow of changes, in a situation
where there is one other developer with a public repository, looks
like this:</p><pre class="literallayout">                      you push
your personal repo ------------------&gt; your public repo
      ^                                     |
      |                                     |
      | you pull                            | they pull
      |                                     |
      |                                     |
      |               they push             V
their public repo &lt;------------------- their repo</pre><p>Now, assume your personal repository is in the directory ~/proj.  We
first create a new clone of the repository:</p><div class="literallayout"><p>$ git clone --bare proj-clone.git</p></div><p>The resulting directory proj-clone.git will contains a "bare" git
repository&#8212;it is just the contents of the ".git" directory, without
a checked-out copy of a working directory.</p><p>Next, copy proj-clone.git to the server where you plan to host the
public repository.  You can use scp, rsync, or whatever is most
convenient.</p><p>If somebody else maintains the public server, they may already have
set up a git service for you, and you may skip to the section
"<a href="#pushing-changes-to-a-public-repository" title="Pushing changes to a public repository">Pushing changes to a public repository</a>", below.</p><p>Otherwise, the following sections explain how to export your newly
created public repository:</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="exporting-via-http"></a>Exporting a git repository via http</h2></div></div></div><p>The git protocol gives better performance and reliability, but on a
host with a web server set up, http exports may be simpler to set up.</p><p>All you need to do is place the newly created bare git repository in
a directory that is exported by the web server, and make some
adjustments to give web clients some extra information they need:</p><div class="literallayout"><p>$ mv proj.git /home/you/public_html/proj.git<br>

<a href="hooks.txt" target="_top">Hooks used by git</a>.)</p><p>Advertise the url of proj.git.  Anybody else should then be able to
clone or pull from that url, for example with a commandline like:</p><div class="literallayout"><p>$ git clone http://yourserver.com/~you/proj.git</p></div><p>(See also

latest changes created in your private repository.</p><p>The simplest way to do this is using <a href="git-push.html" target="_top">git-push(1)</a> and ssh; to
update the remote branch named "master" with the latest state of your

a <a href="#fast-forwards" title="Understanding git history: fast-forwards">fast forward</a>.  Normally this is a sign of
something wrong.  However, if you are sure you know what you're
doing, you may force git-push to perform the update anyway by

assumption.</p><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="id276611"></a>Creating the perfect patch series</h2></div></div></div><p>Suppose you are a contributor to a large project, and you want to add a
complicated feature, and to present it to the other developers in a way
that makes it easy for them to read your changes, verify that they are
correct, and understand why you made each change.</p><p>If you present all of your changes as a single patch (or commit), they
may find that it is too much to digest all at once.</p><p>If you present them with the entire history of your work, complete with
mistakes, corrections, and dead ends, they may be overwhelmed.</p><p>So the ideal is usually to produce a series of patches such that:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li>
Each patch can be applied in order.
</li><li>
Each patch includes a single logical change, together with a
           message explaining the change.
</li><li>
No patch introduces a regression: after applying any initial
           part of the series, the resulting project still compiles and
           works, and has no bugs that it didn't have before.
</li><li>
The complete series produces the same end result as your own
           (probably much messier!) development process did.
</li></ol></div><p>We will introduce some tools that can help you do this, explain how to
use them, and then explain some of the problems that can arise because
you are rewriting history.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="id276686"></a>Keeping a patch series up to date using git-rebase</h2></div></div></div><p>Suppose that you create a branch "mywork" on a remote-tracking branch
"origin", and create some commits on top of it:</p><div class="literallayout"><p>$ git checkout -b mywork origin<br>
$ vi file.txt<br>
$ git commit<br>
$ vi otherfile.txt<br>
$ git commit<br>
...</p></div><p>You have performed no merges into mywork, so it is just a simple linear
sequence of patches on top of "origin":</p><pre class="literallayout">o--o--o &lt;-- origin
                o--o--o &lt;-- mywork</pre><p>Some more interesting work has been done in the upstream project, and
"origin" has advanced:</p><pre class="literallayout">o--o--O--o--o--o &lt;-- origin
                a--b--c &lt;-- mywork</pre><p>At this point, you could use "pull" to merge your changes back in;
the result would create a new merge commit, like this:</p><pre class="literallayout">o--o--O--o--o--o &lt;-- origin
       \                 a--b--c--m &lt;-- mywork</pre><p>However, if you prefer to keep the history in mywork a simple series of
commits without any merges, you may instead choose to use
<a href="git-rebase.html" target="_top">git-rebase(1)</a>:</p><div class="literallayout"><p>$ git checkout mywork<br>
$ git rebase origin</p></div><p>This will remove each of your commits from mywork, temporarily saving
them as patches (in a directory named ".dotest"), update mywork to
point at the latest version of origin, then apply each of the saved
patches to the new mywork.  The result will look like:</p><pre class="literallayout">o--o--O--o--o--o &lt;-- origin
                                  a'--b'--c' &lt;-- mywork</pre><p>In the process, it may discover conflicts.  In that case it will stop
and allow you to fix the conflicts; after fixing conflicts, use "git
add" to update the index with those contents, and then, instead of
running git-commit, just run</p><div class="literallayout"><p>$ git rebase --continue</p></div><p>and git will continue applying the rest of the patches.</p><p>At any point you may use the &#8212;abort option to abort this process and
return mywork to the state it had before you started the rebase:</p><div class="literallayout"><p>$ git rebase --abort</p></div></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="id276817"></a>Reordering or selecting from a patch series</h2></div></div></div><p>Given one existing commit, the <a href="git-cherry-pick.html" target="_top">git-cherry-pick(1)</a> command
allows you to apply the change introduced by that commit and create a
new commit that records it.  So, for example, if "mywork" points to a
series of patches on top of "origin", you might do something like:</p><div class="literallayout"><p>$ git checkout -b mywork-new origin<br>
$ gitk origin..mywork &amp;</p></div><p>And browse through the list of patches in the mywork branch using gitk,
applying them (possibly in a different order) to mywork-new using
cherry-pick, and possibly modifying them as you go using commit
&#8212;amend.</p><p>Another technique is to use git-format-patch to create a series of
patches, then reset the state to before the patches:</p><div class="literallayout"><p>$ git format-patch origin<br>
$ git reset --hard origin</p></div><p>Then modify, reorder, or eliminate patches as preferred before applying
them again with <a href="git-am.html" target="_top">git-am(1)</a>.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="id276878"></a>Other tools</h2></div></div></div><p>There are numerous other tools, such as stgit, which exist for the

with merging.  Suppose somebody fetches your branch and merges it into
their branch, with a result something like this:</p><pre class="literallayout">o--o--O--o--o--o &lt;-- origin
       \                 t--t--t--m &lt;-- their branch:</pre><p>Then suppose you modify the last three commits:</p><pre class="literallayout">        o--o--o &lt;-- new head of origin
       /
o--o--O--o--o--o &lt;-- old head of origin</pre><p>If we examined all this history together in one repository, it will
look like:</p><pre class="literallayout">        o--o--o &lt;-- new head of origin
       /
o--o--O--o--o--o &lt;-- old head of origin
       \                 t--t--t--m &lt;-- their branch:</pre><p>Git has no way of knowing that the new head is an updated version of
the old head; it treats this situation exactly the same as it would if
two developers had independently done the work on the old and new heads
in parallel.  At this point, if someone attempts to merge the new head
in to their branch, git will attempt to merge together the two (old and
new) lines of development, instead of trying to replace the old by the
new.  The results are likely to be unexpected.</p><p>You may still choose to publish branches whose history is rewritten,
and it may be useful for others to be able to fetch those branches in
order to examine or test them, but they should not attempt to pull such
branches into their own work.</p><p>For true distributed development that supports proper merging,
published branches should never be rewritten.</p></div></div><div class="chapter" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a name="id276962"></a>Chapter 7. Advanced branch management</h2></div></div></div><div class="toc"><p><b>Table of Contents</b></p><dl><dt><span class="section"><a href="#id276968">Fetching individual branches</a></span></dt><dt><span class="section"><a href="#fast-forwards">Understanding git history: fast-forwards</a></span></dt><dt><span class="section"><a href="#id277088">Forcing git fetch to do non-fast-forward updates</a></span></dt><dt><span class="section"><a href="#id277115">Configuring remote branches</a></span></dt></dl></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="id276968"></a>Fetching individual branches</h2></div></div></div><p>Instead of using <a href="git-remote.html" target="_top">git-remote(1)</a>, you can also choose just

branch named "master" from the repository at the given URL.  If you
already have a branch named example-master, it will attempt to
"fast-forward" to the commit given by example.com's master branch.  So

                      o--o--o &lt;-- new head of the branch</pre><p>In this case, "git fetch" will fail, and print out a warning.</p><p>In that case, you can still force git to update to the new head, as
described in the following section.  However, note that in the

"current directory cache" aka "index".</p><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="id277250"></a>The Object Database</h2></div></div></div><p>The object database is literally just a content-addressable collection
of objects.  All objects are named by their content, which is
approximated by the SHA1 hash of the object itself.  Objects may refer
to other objects (by referencing their SHA1 hash), and so you can
build up a hierarchy of objects.</p><p>All objects have a statically determined "type" aka "tag", which is
determined at object creation time, and which identifies the format of
the object (i.e. how it is used, and how it can refer to other
objects).  There are currently four different object types: "blob",
"tree", "commit" and "tag".</p><p>A "blob" object cannot refer to any other object, and is, like the type
implies, a pure storage object containing some user data.  It is used to
actually store the file data, i.e. a blob object is associated with some
particular version of some file.</p><p>A "tree" object is an object that ties one or more "blob" objects into a
directory structure. In addition, a tree object can refer to other tree
objects, thus creating a directory hierarchy.</p><p>A "commit" object ties such directory hierarchies together into
a DAG of revisions - each "commit" is associated with exactly one tree
(the directory hierarchy at the time of the commit). In addition, a
"commit" refers to one or more "parent" commit objects that describe the
history of how we arrived at that directory hierarchy.</p><p>As a special case, a commit object with no parents is called the "root"
object, and is the point of an initial project commit.  Each project
must have at least one root, and while you can tie several different
root objects together into one project by creating a commit object which
has two or more separate roots as its ultimate parents, that's probably
just going to confuse people.  So aim for the notion of "one root object
per project", even if git itself does not enforce that.</p><p>A "tag" object symbolically identifies and can be used to sign other
objects. It contains the identifier and type of another object, a
symbolic name (of course!) and, optionally, a signature.</p><p>Regardless of object type, all objects share the following
characteristics: they are all deflated with zlib, and have a header
that not only specifies their type, but also provides size information
about the data in the object.  It's worth noting that the SHA1 hash
that is used to name the object is the hash of the original data
plus this header, so <code class="literal">sha1sum</code> <span class="emphasis"><em>file</em></span> does not match the object name
for <span class="emphasis"><em>file</em></span>.
(Historical note: in the dawn of the age of git the hash
was the sha1 of the <span class="emphasis"><em>compressed</em></span> object.)</p><p>As a result, the general consistency of an object can always be tested
independently of the contents or the type of the object: all objects can
be validated by verifying that (a) their hashes match the content of the
file and (b) the object successfully inflates to a stream of bytes that
forms a sequence of &lt;ascii type without space&gt; + &lt;space&gt; + &lt;ascii decimal
size&gt; + &lt;byte\0&gt; + &lt;binary object data&gt;.</p><p>The structured objects can further have their structure and
connectivity to other objects verified. This is generally done with
the <code class="literal">git-fsck</code> program, which generates a full dependency graph
of all objects, and verifies their internal consistency (in addition
to just verifying their superficial consistency through the hash).</p><p>The object types in some more detail:</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="id277365"></a>Blob Object</h2></div></div></div><p>A "blob" object is nothing but a binary blob of data, and doesn't
refer to anything else.  There is no signature or any other
verification of the data, so while the object is consistent (it <span class="emphasis"><em>is</em></span>
indexed by its sha1 hash, so the data itself is certainly correct), it
has absolutely no other attributes.  No name associations, no
permissions.  It is purely a blob of data (i.e. normally "file
contents").</p><p>In particular, since the blob is entirely defined by its data, if two
files in a directory tree (or in multiple different versions of the
repository) have the same contents, they will share the same blob
object. The object is totally independent of its location in the
directory tree, and renaming a file does not change the object that
file is associated with in any way.</p><p>A blob is typically created when <a href="git-update-index.html" target="_top">git-update-index(1)</a>
is run, and its data can be accessed by <a href="git-cat-file.html" target="_top">git-cat-file(1)</a>.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="id277409"></a>Tree Object</h2></div></div></div><p>The next hierarchical object type is the "tree" object.  A tree object
is a list of mode/name/blob data, sorted by name.  Alternatively, the
mode data may specify a directory mode, in which case instead of
naming a blob, that name is associated with another TREE object.</p><p>Like the "blob" object, a tree object is uniquely determined by the
set contents, and so two separate but identical trees will always
share the exact same object. This is true at all levels, i.e. it's
true for a "leaf" tree (which does not refer to any other trees, only
blobs) as well as for a whole subdirectory.</p><p>For that reason a "tree" object is just a pure data abstraction: it
has no history, no signatures, no verification of validity, except
that since the contents are again protected by the hash itself, we can
trust that the tree is immutable and its contents never change.</p><p>So you can trust the contents of a tree to be valid, the same way you
can trust the contents of a blob, but you don't know where those
contents <span class="emphasis"><em>came</em></span> from.</p><p>Side note on trees: since a "tree" object is a sorted list of
"filename+content", you can create a diff between two trees without
actually having to unpack two trees.  Just ignore all common parts,
and your diff will look right.  In other words, you can effectively
(and efficiently) tell the difference between any two random trees by
O(n) where "n" is the size of the difference, rather than the size of
the tree.</p><p>Side note 2 on trees: since the name of a "blob" depends entirely and
exclusively on its contents (i.e. there are no names or permissions
involved), you can see trivial renames or permission changes by
noticing that the blob stayed the same.  However, renames with data
changes need a smarter "diff" implementation.</p><p>A tree is created with <a href="git-write-tree.html" target="_top">git-write-tree(1)</a> and
its data can be accessed by <a href="git-ls-tree.html" target="_top">git-ls-tree(1)</a>.
Two trees can be compared with <a href="git-diff-tree.html" target="_top">git-diff-tree(1)</a>.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="id277486"></a>Commit Object</h2></div></div></div><p>The "commit" object is an object that introduces the notion of
history into the picture.  In contrast to the other objects, it
doesn't just describe the physical state of a tree, it describes how
we got there, and why.</p><p>A "commit" is defined by the tree-object that it results in, the
parent commits (zero, one or more) that led up to that point, and a
comment on what happened.  Again, a commit is not trusted per se:
the contents are well-defined and "safe" due to the cryptographically
strong signatures at all levels, but there is no reason to believe
that the tree is "good" or that the merge information makes sense.
The parents do not have to actually have any relationship with the
result, for example.</p><p>Note on commits: unlike real SCM's, commits do not contain
rename information or file mode change information.  All of that is
implicit in the trees involved (the result tree, and the result trees
of the parents), and describing that makes no sense in this idiotic
file manager.</p><p>A commit is created with <a href="git-commit-tree.html" target="_top">git-commit-tree(1)</a> and
its data can be accessed by <a href="git-cat-file.html" target="_top">git-cat-file(1)</a>.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="id277533"></a>Trust</h2></div></div></div><p>An aside on the notion of "trust". Trust is really outside the scope
of "git", but it's worth noting a few things.  First off, since
everything is hashed with SHA1, you <span class="emphasis"><em>can</em></span> trust that an object is
intact and has not been messed with by external sources.  So the name
of an object uniquely identifies a known state - just not a state that
you may want to trust.</p><p>Furthermore, since the SHA1 signature of a commit refers to the
SHA1 signatures of the tree it is associated with and the signatures
of the parent, a single named commit specifies uniquely a whole set
of history, with full contents.  You can't later fake any step of the
way once you have the name of a commit.</p><p>So to introduce some real trust in the system, the only thing you need
to do is to digitally sign just <span class="emphasis"><em>one</em></span> special note, which includes the
name of a top-level commit.  Your digital signature shows others
that you trust that commit, and the immutability of the history of
commits tells others that they can trust the whole history.</p><p>In other words, you can easily validate a whole archive by just
sending out a single email that tells the people the name (SHA1 hash)
of the top commit, and digitally sign that email using something
like GPG/PGP.</p><p>To assist in this, git also provides the tag object&#8230;</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="id277583"></a>Tag Object</h2></div></div></div><p>Git provides the "tag" object to simplify creating, managing and
exchanging symbolic and signed tokens.  The "tag" object at its
simplest simply symbolically identifies another object by containing
the sha1, type and symbolic name.</p><p>However it can optionally contain additional signature information
(which git doesn't care about as long as there's less than 8k of
it). This can then be verified externally to git.</p><p>Note that despite the tag features, "git" itself only handles content
integrity; the trust framework (and signature provision and
verification) has to come from outside.</p><p>A tag is created with <a href="git-mktag.html" target="_top">git-mktag(1)</a>,
its data can be accessed by <a href="git-cat-file.html" target="_top">git-cat-file(1)</a>,
and the signature can be verified by
<a href="git-verify-tag.html" target="_top">git-verify-tag(1)</a>.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="id277630"></a>The "index" aka "Current Directory Cache"</h2></div></div></div><p>The index is a simple binary file, which contains an efficient
representation of a virtual directory content at some random time.  It
does so by a simple array that associates a set of names, dates,
permissions and content (aka "blob") objects together.  The cache is
always kept ordered by name, and names are unique (with a few very
specific rules) at any point in time, but the cache has no long-term
meaning, and can be partially updated at any time.</p><p>In particular, the index certainly does not need to be consistent with
the current directory contents (in fact, most operations will depend on
different ways to make the index <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> be consistent with the directory
hierarchy), but it has three very important attributes:</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>(a) it can re-generate the full state it caches (not just the
directory structure: it contains pointers to the "blob" objects so
that it can regenerate the data too)</em></span></p><p>As a special case, there is a clear and unambiguous one-way mapping
from a current directory cache to a "tree object", which can be
efficiently created from just the current directory cache without
actually looking at any other data.  So a directory cache at any one
time uniquely specifies one and only one "tree" object (but has
additional data to make it easy to match up that tree object with what
has happened in the directory)</p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>(b) it has efficient methods for finding inconsistencies between that
cached state ("tree object waiting to be instantiated") and the
current state.</em></span></p><p><span class="emphasis"><em>(c) it can additionally efficiently represent information about merge
conflicts between different tree objects, allowing each pathname to be
associated with sufficient information about the trees involved that
you can create a three-way merge between them.</em></span></p><p>Those are the ONLY three things that the directory cache does.  It's a
cache, and the normal operation is to re-generate it completely from a
known tree object, or update/compare it with a live tree that is being
developed.  If you blow the directory cache away entirely, you generally
haven't lost any information as long as you have the name of the tree
that it described.</p><p>At the same time, the index is at the same time also the
staging area for creating new trees, and creating a new tree always
involves a controlled modification of the index file.  In particular,
the index file can have the representation of an intermediate tree that
has not yet been instantiated.  So the index can be thought of as a
write-back cache, which can contain dirty information that has not yet
been written back to the backing store.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="id277705"></a>The Workflow</h2></div></div></div><p>Generally, all "git" operations work on the index file. Some operations
work <span class="strong"><strong>purely</strong></span> on the index file (showing the current state of the
index), but most operations move data to and from the index file. Either
from the database or from the working directory. Thus there are four
main combinations:</p><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id277724"></a>working directory -&gt; index</h3></div></div></div><p>You update the index with information from the working directory with
the <a href="git-update-index.html" target="_top">git-update-index(1)</a> command.  You
generally update the index information by just specifying the filename
you want to update, like so:</p><div class="literallayout"><p>$ git-update-index filename</p></div><p>but to avoid common mistakes with filename globbing etc, the command
will not normally add totally new entries or remove old entries,
i.e. it will normally just update existing cache entries.</p><p>To tell git that yes, you really do realize that certain files no
longer exist, or that new files should be added, you
should use the <code class="literal">&#8212;remove</code> and <code class="literal">&#8212;add</code> flags respectively.</p><p>NOTE! A <code class="literal">&#8212;remove</code> flag does <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> mean that subsequent filenames will
necessarily be removed: if the files still exist in your directory
structure, the index will be updated with their new status, not
removed. The only thing <code class="literal">&#8212;remove</code> means is that update-cache will be
considering a removed file to be a valid thing, and if the file really
does not exist any more, it will update the index accordingly.</p><p>As a special case, you can also do <code class="literal">git-update-index &#8212;refresh</code>, which
will refresh the "stat" information of each index to match the current
stat information. It will <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> update the object status itself, and
it will only update the fields that are used to quickly test whether
an object still matches its old backing store object.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id277813"></a>index -&gt; object database</h3></div></div></div><p>You write your current index file to a "tree" object with the program</p><div class="literallayout"><p>$ git-write-tree</p></div><p>that doesn't come with any options - it will just write out the
current index into the set of tree objects that describe that state,
and it will return the name of the resulting top-level tree. You can
use that tree to re-generate the index at any time by going in the
other direction:</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id277841"></a>object database -&gt; index</h3></div></div></div><p>You read a "tree" file from the object database, and use that to
populate (and overwrite - don't do this if your index contains any
unsaved state that you might want to restore later!) your current
index.  Normal operation is just</p><div class="literallayout"><p>$ git-read-tree &lt;sha1 of tree&gt;</p></div><p>and your index file will now be equivalent to the tree that you saved
earlier. However, that is only your <span class="emphasis"><em>index</em></span> file: your working
directory contents have not been modified.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id277872"></a>index -&gt; working directory</h3></div></div></div><p>You update your working directory from the index by "checking out"
files. This is not a very common operation, since normally you'd just
keep your files updated, and rather than write to your working
directory, you'd tell the index files about the changes in your
working directory (i.e. <code class="literal">git-update-index</code>).</p><p>However, if you decide to jump to a new version, or check out somebody
else's version, or just restore a previous tree, you'd populate your
index file with read-tree, and then you need to check out the result
with</p><div class="literallayout"><p>$ git-checkout-index filename</p></div><p>or, if you want to check out all of the index, use <code class="literal">-a</code>.</p><p>NOTE! git-checkout-index normally refuses to overwrite old files, so
if you have an old version of the tree already checked out, you will
need to use the "-f" flag (<span class="emphasis"><em>before</em></span> the "-a" flag or the filename) to
<span class="emphasis"><em>force</em></span> the checkout.</p><p>Finally, there are a few odds and ends which are not purely moving
from one representation to the other:</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="id277936"></a>Tying it all together</h3></div></div></div><p>To commit a tree you have instantiated with "git-write-tree", you'd
create a "commit" object that refers to that tree and the history
behind it - most notably the "parent" commits that preceded it in
history.</p><p>Normally a "commit" has one parent: the previous state of the tree
before a certain change was made. However, sometimes it can have two
or more parent commits, in which case we call it a "merge", due to the
fact that such a commit brings together ("merges") two or more
previous states represented by other commits.</p><p>In other words, while a "tree" represents a particular directory state
of a working directory, a "commit" represents that state in "time",
and explains how we got there.</p><p>You create a commit object by giving it the tree that describes the
state at the time of the commit, and a list of parents:</p><div class="literallayout"><p>$ git-commit-tree &lt;tree&gt; -p &lt;parent&gt; [-p &lt;parent2&gt; ..]</p></div><p>and then giving the reason for the commit on stdin (either through
redirection from a pipe or file, or by just typing it at the tty).</p><p>git-commit-tree will return the name of the object that represents
that commit, and you should save it away for later use. Normally,
you'd commit a new <code class="literal">HEAD</code> state, and while git doesn't care where you
save the note about that state, in practice we tend to just write the
result to the file pointed at by <code class="literal">.git/HEAD</code>, so that we can always see
what the last committed state was.</p><p>Here is an ASCII art by Jon Loeliger that illustrates how
various pieces fit together.</p><div class="literallayout"><p><br>

there is a special helper for showing that content, called
<code class="literal">git-ls-tree</code>, which turns the binary content into a more easily
readable form.</p><p>It's especially instructive to look at "commit" objects, since those
tend to be small and fairly self-explanatory. In particular, if you

you can do</p><div class="literallayout"><p>$ git-cat-file commit HEAD</p></div><p>to see what the top commit was.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="id278108"></a>Merging multiple trees</h2></div></div></div><p>Git helps you do a three-way merge, which you can expand to n-way by
repeating the merge procedure arbitrary times until you finally
"commit" the state.  The normal situation is that you'd only do one
three-way merge (two parents), and commit it, but if you like to, you
can do multiple parents in one go.</p><p>To do a three-way merge, you need the two sets of "commit" objects
that you want to merge, use those to find the closest common parent (a
third "commit" object), and then use those commit objects to find the
state of the directory ("tree" object) at these points.</p><p>To get the "base" for the merge, you first look up the common parent
of two commits with</p><div class="literallayout"><p>$ git-merge-base &lt;commit1&gt; &lt;commit2&gt;</p></div><p>which will return you the commit they are both based on.  You should
now look up the "tree" objects of those commits, which you can easily
do with (for example)</p><div class="literallayout"><p>$ git-cat-file commit &lt;commitname&gt; | head -1</p></div><p>since the tree object information is always the first line in a commit
object.</p><p>Once you know the three trees you are going to merge (the one "original"
tree, aka the common case, and the two "result" trees, aka the branches
you want to merge), you do a "merge" read into the index. This will
complain if it has to throw away your old index contents, so you should
make sure that you've committed those - in fact you would normally
always do a merge against your last commit (which should thus match what
you have in your current index anyway).</p><p>To do the merge, do</p><div class="literallayout"><p>$ git-read-tree -m -u &lt;origtree&gt; &lt;yourtree&gt; &lt;targettree&gt;</p></div><p>which will do all trivial merge operations for you directly in the
index file, and you can just write the result out with
<code class="literal">git-write-tree</code>.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="id278195"></a>Merging multiple trees, continued</h2></div></div></div><p>Sadly, many merges aren't trivial. If there are files that have
been added.moved or removed, or if both branches have modified the
same file, you will be left with an index tree that contains "merge
entries" in it. Such an index tree can <span class="emphasis"><em>NOT</em></span> be written out to a tree
object, and you will have to resolve any such merge clashes using
other tools before you can write out the result.</p><p>You can examine such index state with <code class="literal">git-ls-files &#8212;unmerged</code>
command.  An example:</p><div class="literallayout"><p>$ git-read-tree -m $orig HEAD $target<br>
$ git-ls-files --unmerged<br>
100644 263414f423d0e4d70dae8fe53fa34614ff3e2860 1       hello.c<br>
100644 06fa6a24256dc7e560efa5687fa84b51f0263c3a 2       hello.c<br>
100644 cc44c73eb783565da5831b4d820c962954019b69 3       hello.c</p></div><p>Each line of the <code class="literal">git-ls-files &#8212;unmerged</code> output begins with
the blob mode bits, blob SHA1, <span class="emphasis"><em>stage number</em></span>, and the
filename.  The <span class="emphasis"><em>stage number</em></span> is git's way to say which tree it
came from: stage 1 corresponds to <code class="literal">$orig</code> tree, stage 2 <code class="literal">HEAD</code>
tree, and stage3 <code class="literal">$target</code> tree.</p><p>Earlier we said that trivial merges are done inside
<code class="literal">git-read-tree -m</code>.  For example, if the file did not change
from <code class="literal">$orig</code> to <code class="literal">HEAD</code> nor <code class="literal">$target</code>, or if the file changed
from <code class="literal">$orig</code> to <code class="literal">HEAD</code> and <code class="literal">$orig</code> to <code class="literal">$target</code> the same way,
obviously the final outcome is what is in <code class="literal">HEAD</code>.  What the
above example shows is that file <code class="literal">hello.c</code> was changed from
<code class="literal">$orig</code> to <code class="literal">HEAD</code> and <code class="literal">$orig</code> to <code class="literal">$target</code> in a different way.
You could resolve this by running your favorite 3-way merge
program, e.g.  <code class="literal">diff3</code> or <code class="literal">merge</code>, on the blob objects from
these three stages yourself, like this:</p><div class="literallayout"><p>$ git-cat-file blob 263414f... &gt;hello.c~1<br>
$ git-cat-file blob 06fa6a2... &gt;hello.c~2<br>
$ git-cat-file blob cc44c73... &gt;hello.c~3<br>
$ merge hello.c~2 hello.c~1 hello.c~3</p></div><p>This would leave the merge result in <code class="literal">hello.c~2</code> file, along
with conflict markers if there are conflicts.  After verifying
the merge result makes sense, you can tell git what the final
merge result for this file is by:</p><div class="literallayout"><p>$ mv -f hello.c~2 hello.c<br>
$ git-update-index hello.c</p></div><p>When a path is in unmerged state, running <code class="literal">git-update-index</code> for
that path tells git to mark the path resolved.</p><p>The above is the description of a git merge at the lowest level,
to help you understand what conceptually happens under the hood.
In practice, nobody, not even git itself, uses three <code class="literal">git-cat-file</code>
for this.  There is <code class="literal">git-merge-index</code> program that extracts the
stages to temporary files and calls a "merge" script on it:</p><div class="literallayout"><p>$ git-merge-index git-merge-one-file hello.c</p></div><p>and that is what higher level <code class="literal">git merge -s resolve</code> is implemented with.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="id278455"></a>How git stores objects efficiently: pack files</h2></div></div></div><p>We've seen how git stores each object in a file named after the
object's SHA1 hash.</p><p>Unfortunately this system becomes inefficient once a project has a
lot of objects.  Try this on an old project:</p><div class="literallayout"><p>$ git count-objects<br>
6930 objects, 47620 kilobytes</p></div><p>The first number is the number of objects which are kept in
individual files.  The second is the amount of space taken up by
those "loose" objects.</p><p>You can save space and make git faster by moving these loose objects in
to a "pack file", which stores a group of objects in an efficient
compressed format; the details of how pack files are formatted can be
found in <a href="technical/pack-format.txt" target="_top">technical/pack-format.txt</a>.</p><p>To put the loose objects into a pack, just run git repack:</p><div class="literallayout"><p>$ git repack<br>

pack.  This will also remove any unreferenced objects (which may be
created when, for example, you use "git reset" to remove a commit).
You can verify that the loose objects are gone by looking at the
.git/objects directory or by running</p><div class="literallayout"><p>$ git count-objects<br>

objects will work exactly as they did before.</p><p>The <a href="git-gc.html" target="_top">git-gc(1)</a> command performs packing, pruning, and more for
you, so is normally the only high-level command you need.</p></div><div class="section" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="dangling-objects"></a>Dangling objects</h2></div></div></div><p>The <a href="git-fsck.html" target="_top">git-fsck(1)</a> command will sometimes complain about dangling
objects.  They are not a problem.</p><p>The most common cause of dangling objects is that you've rebased a
branch, or you have pulled from somebody else who rebased a branch&#8212;see
<a href="#cleaning-up-history" title="Chapter 6. Rewriting history and maintaining patch series">Chapter 6, <i>Rewriting history and maintaining patch series</i></a>.  In that case, the old head of the original
branch still exists, as does obviously everything it pointed to. The
branch pointer itself just doesn't, since you replaced it with another
one.</p><p>There are also other situations too that cause dangling objects. For
example, a "dangling blob" may arise because you did a "git add" of a
file, but then, before you actually committed it and made it part of the
bigger picture, you changed something else in that file and committed
that <span class="strong"><strong>updated</strong></span> thing - the old state that you added originally ends up
not being pointed to by any commit or tree, so it's now a dangling blob
object.</p><p>Similarly, when the "recursive" merge strategy runs, and finds that
there are criss-cross merges and thus more than one merge base (which is
fairly unusual, but it does happen), it will generate one temporary
midway tree (or possibly even more, if you had lots of criss-crossing
merges and more than two merge bases) as a temporary internal merge
base, and again, those are real objects, but the end result will not end
up pointing to them, so they end up "dangling" in your repository.</p><p>Generally, dangling objects aren't anything to worry about. They can
even be very useful: if you screw something up, the dangling objects can
be how you recover your old tree (say, you did a rebase, and realized
that you really didn't want to - you can look at what dangling objects
you have, and decide to reset your head to some old dangling state).</p><p>For commits, the most useful thing to do with dangling objects tends to
be to do a simple</p><div class="literallayout"><p>$ gitk &lt;dangling-commit-sha-goes-here&gt; --not --all</p></div><p>For blobs and trees, you can't do the same, but you can examine them.
You can just do</p><div class="literallayout"><p>$ git show &lt;dangling-blob/tree-sha-goes-here&gt;</p></div><p>to show what the contents of the blob were (or, for a tree, basically
what the "ls" for that directory was), and that may give you some idea
of what the operation was that left that dangling object.</p><p>Usually, dangling blobs and trees aren't very interesting. They're
almost always the result of either being a half-way mergebase (the blob
will often even have the conflict markers from a merge in it, if you
have had conflicting merges that you fixed up by hand), or simply
because you interrupted a "git fetch" with ^C or something like that,
leaving _some_ of the new objects in the object database, but just
dangling and useless.</p><p>Anyway, once you are sure that you're not interested in any dangling
state, you can just prune all unreachable objects:</p><div class="literallayout"><p>$ git prune</p></div><p>and they'll be gone. But you should only run "git prune" on a quiescent
repository - it's kind of like doing a filesystem fsck recovery: you
don't want to do that while the filesystem is mounted.</p><p>(The same is true of "git-fsck" itself, btw - but since
git-fsck never actually <span class="strong"><strong>changes</strong></span> the repository, it just reports
on what it found, git-fsck itself is never "dangerous" to run.
Running it while somebody is actually changing the repository can cause
confusing and scary messages, but it won't actually do anything bad. In
contrast, running "git prune" while somebody is actively changing the
repository is a <span class="strong"><strong>BAD</strong></span> idea).</p></div></div><div class="chapter" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a name="id278715"></a>Chapter 9. Glossary of git terms</h2></div></div></div><div class="variablelist"><dl><dt><span class="term">

bare repository
</span></dt><dd>
        A bare repository is normally an appropriately named
        directory with a <code class="literal">.git</code> suffix that does not have a
        locally checked-out copy of any of the files under revision

        hidden <code class="literal">.git</code> sub-directory are directly present in
        the <code class="literal">repository.git</code> directory instead, and no other files
        are present and checked out.  Usually publishers of public
        repositories make bare repositories available.

chain
</span></dt><dd>
        A list of objects, where each object in the list contains a
        reference to its successor (for example, the successor of a commit
        could be one of its parents).
</dd><dt><span class="term">
changeset
</span></dt><dd>
        BitKeeper/cvsps speak for "commit". Since git does not store
        changes, but states, it really does not make sense to use
        the term "changesets" with git.
</dd><dt><span class="term">

</dd><dt><span class="term">
cherry-picking
</span></dt><dd>
        In SCM jargon, "cherry pick" means to choose a subset of
        changes out of a series of changes (typically commits)
        and record them as a new series of changes on top of
        different codebase.  In GIT, this is performed by
        "git cherry-pick" command to extract the change
        introduced by an existing commit and to record it based
        on the tip of the current branch as a new commit.
</dd><dt><span class="term">

fast forward
</span></dt><dd>
        A fast-forward is a special type of merge where you have
        a revision and you are "merging" another branch's changes
        that happen to be a descendant of what you have.
        In such these cases, you do not make a new merge commit but
        instead just update to his revision. This will happen
        frequently on a tracking branch of a remote repository.
</dd><dt><span class="term">
fetch
</span></dt><dd>
        Fetching a branch means to get the branch's head ref from a

</dd><dt><span class="term">
hook
</span></dt><dd>
        During the normal execution of several git commands,
        call-outs are made to optional scripts that allow
        a developer to add functionality or checking.
        Typically, the hooks allow for a command to be pre-verified
        and potentially aborted, and allow for a post-notification
        after the operation is done.
        The hook scripts are found in the <code class="literal">$GIT_DIR/hooks/</code> directory,
        and are enabled by simply making them executable.
</dd><dt><span class="term">
index
</span></dt><dd>
        A collection of files with stat information, whose contents are
        stored as objects. The index is a stored version of your working

        version of a working tree, which are used when merging.
</dd><dt><span class="term">

</span></dt><dd>
        The information regarding a particular file, stored in the index.
        An index entry can be unmerged, if a merge was started, but not

        that file).
</dd><dt><span class="term">
master
</span></dt><dd>
        The default development branch. Whenever you create a git
        repository, a branch named "master" is created, and becomes
        the active branch. In most cases, this contains the local
        development, though that is purely conventional and not required.
</dd><dt><span class="term">
merge
</span></dt><dd>
        To merge branches means to try to accumulate the changes since a

        merge can fail.
</dd><dt><span class="term">

        All of the ancestors of a given commit are said to be reachable from
        that commit.  More generally, one object is reachable from another if

</span></dt><dd>
        The action of fixing up manually what a failed automatic merge
        left behind.
</dd><dt><span class="term">
revision
</span></dt><dd>
        A particular state of files and directories which was stored in
        the object database. It is referenced by a commit object.
</dd><dt><span class="term">
rewind
</span></dt><dd>
        To throw away part of the development, i.e. to assign the head to
        an earlier revision.
</dd><dt><span class="term">
SCM
</span></dt><dd>
        Source code management (tool).
</dd><dt><span class="term">
SHA1
</span></dt><dd>
        Synonym for object name.

shallow repository
</span></dt><dd>
        A shallow repository has an incomplete history some of
        whose commits have parents cauterized away (in other
        words, git is told to pretend that these commits do not
        have the parents, even though they are recorded in the
        commit object).  This is sometimes useful when you are
        interested only in the recent history of a project even
        though the real history recorded in the upstream is
        much larger.  A shallow repository is created by giving
        <code class="literal">&#8212;depth</code> option to <a href="git-clone.html" target="_top">git-clone(1)</a>, and its
        history can be later deepened with <a href="git-fetch.html" target="_top">git-fetch(1)</a>.
</dd><dt><span class="term">
symref
</span></dt><dd>
        Symbolic reference: instead of containing the SHA1 id itself, it
        is of the format <span class="emphasis"><em>ref: refs/some/thing</em></span> and when referenced, it
        recursively dereferences to this reference. <span class="emphasis"><em>HEAD</em></span> is a prime
        example of a symref. Symbolic references are manipulated with
        the <a href="git-symbolic-ref.html" target="_top">git-symbolic-ref(1)</a> command.
</dd><dt><span class="term">
topic branch
</span></dt><dd>
        A regular git branch that is used by a developer to
        identify a conceptual line of development.  Since branches
        are very easy and inexpensive, it is often desirable to
        have several small branches that each contain very well
        defined concepts or small incremental yet related changes.
</dd><dt><span class="term">
tracking branch
</span></dt><dd>
        A regular git branch that is used to follow changes from
        another repository.  A tracking branch should not contain
        direct modifications or have local commits made to it.
        A tracking branch can usually be identified as the
        right-hand-side ref in a Pull: refspec.
</dd><dt><span class="term">
tree object
</span></dt><dd>
        An object containing a list of file names and modes along with refs
        to the associated blob and/or tree objects. A tree is equivalent
        to a directory.
</dd><dt><span class="term">
tree
</span></dt><dd>
        Either a working tree, or a tree object together with the
        dependent blob and tree objects (i.e. a stored representation
        of a working tree).
</dd><dt><span class="term">
tree-ish
</span></dt><dd>
        A ref pointing to either a commit object, a tree object, or a
        tag object pointing to a tag or commit or tree object.
</dd><dt><span class="term">
tag object
</span></dt><dd>
        An object containing a ref pointing to another object, which can
        contain a message just like a commit object. It can also
        contain a (PGP) signature, in which case it is called a "signed
        tag object".
</dd><dt><span class="term">
tag
</span></dt><dd>
        A ref pointing to a tag or commit object. In contrast to a head,
        a tag is not changed by a commit. Tags (not tag objects) are
        stored in <code class="literal">$GIT_DIR/refs/tags/</code>. A git tag has nothing to do with
        a Lisp tag (which is called object type in git's context).
        A tag is most typically used to mark a particular point in the
        commit ancestry chain.

unmerged index
</span></dt><dd>
        An index which contains unmerged index entries.
</dd><dt><span class="term">
working tree
</span></dt><dd>
        The set of files and directories currently being worked on,
        i.e. you can work in your working tree without using git at all.

        - It must be readable in order, from beginning to end, by
          someone intelligent with a basic grasp of the unix
          commandline, but without any special knowledge of git.  If
          necessary, any other prerequisites should be specifically
          mentioned as they arise.
        - Whenever possible, section headings should clearly describe
          the task they explain how to do, in language that requires
          no more knowledge than necessary: for example, "importing
          patches into a project" rather than "the git-am command"</p><p>Think about how to create a clear chapter dependency graph that will
allow people to get to important topics without necessarily reading
everything in between.</p><p>Say something about .gitignore.</p><p>Scan Documentation/ for other stuff left out; in particular:
        howto's
        some of technical/?
        hooks
        list of commands in <a href="git.html" target="_top">git(1)</a></p><p>Scan email archives for other stuff left out</p><p>Scan man pages to see if any assume more background than this manual
provides.</p><p>Simplify beginning by suggesting disconnected head instead of
temporary branch creation?</p><p>Explain how to refer to file stages in the "how to resolve a merge"
section: diff -1, -2, -3, &#8212;ours, &#8212;theirs :1:/path notation.  The
"git ls-files &#8212;unmerged &#8212;stage" thing is sorta useful too,
actually.  And note gitk &#8212;merge.</p><p>Add more good examples.  Entire sections of just cookbook examples
might be a good idea; maybe make an "advanced examples" section a
standard end-of-chapter section?</p><p>Include cross-references to the glossary, where appropriate.</p><p>Document shallow clones?  See draft 1.5.0 release notes for some
documentation.</p><p>Add a section on working with other version control systems, including
CVS, Subversion, and just imports of series of release tarballs.</p><p>More details on gitweb?</p><p>Write a chapter on using plumbing and writing scripts.</p></div></div></body></html>
